# L(3,2,1)-labeling

A backtracking program that searches for all k-L(3,2,1)-labelings of a given simple graph with a given maximum label k.

----------------------------

A python program that generates all k-L(3,2,1)-labelings 
of a simple undirected graph with up to k labels.
In order to setup the value k, change the value of the variable 
maxLabel in the program to the desired value.

------------------
usage
------------------
This program was built for the python interpreter.
To run the program, type 'python L(3,2,1)-labeling.py' in
the terminal. Make sure your terminal session is in
the directory that contains the file 'L(3,2,1)-labeling.py'.

------------------
edges.txt
------------------
The file edges.txt contains the adjacency list of the graph
to be verified. An edge in the list is formatted '[a,b]' 
where a and b are integers corresponding to vertices in the
graph. The vertices must be 0-indexed.
